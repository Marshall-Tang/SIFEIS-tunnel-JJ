# Superconductor-insulator-ferroelectrics-insulator-superconductor (S-I-FE-I-S) Josephson junction model

## Outline

A tunnel junction model for a Josephson junction with composite insulator-ferroelectrics-insulator barrier. Then critical (super)current is computed against various parameters, such as ferroelectric polarization, ferroelectric dielectric constant, ferroelectric thickness, insulating barrier thicknesses, insulating potential barrier heights...

## Reproduction

Simulation scripts can be simply used as

```
python -m src.experiments.<experiment_name>
```

For example,

```
python -m src.experiments.polarization_dependence
```
